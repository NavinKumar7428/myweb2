  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Grilled steak is a classic dish known for its bold flavors, smoky aroma, and juicy tenderness. From backyard cookouts to upscale restaurants, grilled steak continues to win hearts with its irresistible appeal.</p>

  <h2>Flavor Profile</h2>
  <p>The flavor of grilled steak is a perfect balance of savory, smoky, and slightly charred richness. High-quality beef cuts like ribeye, sirloin, and filet mignon bring out deep umami notes. The seared exterior offers a slightly crispy, caramelized crust, while the inside remains juicy, tender, and full of natural beef flavor.</p>

  <h2>Aroma</h2>
  <p>The aroma of grilled steak is mouthwatering—smoky from the grill, slightly sweet from caramelized fat, and infused with spices or herbs used during cooking. It's the kind of scent that instantly makes you hungry.</p>

  <h2>Texture</h2>
  <p>A perfectly grilled steak has a satisfying contrast in texture: a crisp, seared crust on the outside and a soft, succulent interior. The marbling (fat) in the meat melts during cooking, keeping the steak moist and tender.</p>

  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose your cut: ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, etc.</li>
    <li>Season simply with salt, pepper, and optional garlic or herbs.</li>
    <li>Grill over high heat (450°F / 230°C) to sear both sides.</li>
    <li>Use a thermometer for doneness: 135°F (medium rare), 145°F (medium).</li>
    <li>Let the steak rest 5–10 minutes before slicing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
  <p>Grilled steak pairs wonderfully with both rustic and refined sides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Grilled vegetables (asparagus, bell peppers, mushrooms)</li>
    <li>Mashed or roasted potatoes</li>
    <li>Garlic herb butter or chimichurri sauce</li>
    <li>Fresh garden salad or coleslaw</li>
    <li>Warm dinner rolls or garlic bread</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
  <p>In moderation, steak is a nutrient-rich protein source. It provides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-quality protein for muscle maintenance</li>
    <li>Iron, which supports oxygen flow in the blood</li>
    <li>Vitamin B12 for nerve function</li>
    <li>Zinc for immune health</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Choose leaner cuts and grill without excessive oil to keep it healthier.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Grilled steak is more than just a meal—it's a celebration of flavor, fire, and tradition. Whether you're grilling at home or enjoying it in a steakhouse, the experience of a perfectly grilled steak is always memorable.</p>
